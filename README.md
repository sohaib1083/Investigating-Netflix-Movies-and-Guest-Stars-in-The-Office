# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office
Netflix have a large number of movies and series available on the platform. The Dataset I have worked on consists of the information For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively. In this notebook I have created a Dataframe from a dictionary and implemented different concepts ie, loading and reading csv, filtering movies, done visualization on data and many more.
